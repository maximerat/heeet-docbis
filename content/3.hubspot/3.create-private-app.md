# Create Private App

Follow these steps to create a private app in HubSpot that allows Heeet to create custom objects and fields:

1. Go to your HubSpot account settings, navigate to **Account Management**, then select **Integrations > Private Apps**

2. Click the **Create a private app** button

3. Set the app name to: `Heeet - objects/fields`

4. Under **Scopes**, enable the following permissions:
   - `crm.schemas.contacts.write`
   - `crm.schemas.custom.write`
   - `crm.schemas.deals.write`
   - `crm.schemas.companies.write`
   - `marketing.campaigns.write`

5. Click **Create app** to save your changes

6. After creation, go to the **Auth** tab and copy the access token - you'll need this to complete the Heeet integration

See below in [Objects and Fields](#objects-and-fields) what will be created in your HubSpot account.
