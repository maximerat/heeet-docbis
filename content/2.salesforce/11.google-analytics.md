## Create Data Trigger

Once you added a GA4 account, you can create a « data
trigger ».
A trigger is an event happening in Salesforce that should be
sent to GA4 as an event
- To create your first event, go to `Go to Heeet > Settings > Google Analytics > Event Triggers` Click on `New`

### Create Data Trigger Conditions

You can define what should be the Salesforce conditions to
activate this trigger and send the data to GA4.
- Click on « Add »
- Select the field on which you want to apply a condition
- Fill in the value which should trigger the event

Please note that you have to paste the API name of the
field value.
Exemple:
You want to send an event to GA4 when a lead is
converted. Then you will have to select the API name of
the Lead Status field

### Create Data Trigger Values

Once you completed the Conditions part, you can customize the Event values.
You can send either a String value, a Number value or use a Field value from the selected object.
We usually recommend to use the following Event Fields.
- **Event Category** : we usually tell our customers to use a generic value to easily find all events related to a specific Category such as `Salesforce Offline Event`, we recommend to use a string value
- **Event Label** : here you can set a clear label such as `Converted Lead` or `Salesforce Closed Won Opportunity`, we recommend to use a string value,
- **Event Action** : you can set a string value such as `Heeet Automated Event`
- **Event Value** : usually we recommend our customers to use a number field set to 1 for unique events such as `converted leads` but to use an object value for transactional event such as `closed won opportunity`. If you want to send the Amount Opportunity value, then select type = Field and value
- **Event Name** : you need to create first an event in GA4 and use the exact same event name as string value
