# Bing Ads

## Setup

In Salesforce, click on the app launcher and search for `Heeet`.
The Heeet settings page will open in a new window.
For each integration you want to activate, click on the
"Sign Up" / "Connect" button.
Select a start date from which you'd like to start
getting your campaigns data in Salesforce.

## Select Start Date

Set a start date (we recommend to use today date to avoid syncing historical data and startcollecting campaign costs, impressions and clicks from today) + click on `Save`
