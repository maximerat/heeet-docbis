# Google Ads

## Setup

In Salesforce, click on the app launcher and search for `Heeet`.
The Heeet settings page will open in a new window.
For each integration you want to activate, click on the
"Sign Up" / "Connect" button.
Select a start date from which you'd like to start
getting your campaigns data in Salesforce.

## Select Start Date

Set a start date (we recommend to use today date to avoid syncing historical data and startcollecting campaign costs, impressions and clicks from today) + click on `Save`

- Go to `Heeet Settings > Integrations > Google Ads` **(A)**
- Click on `Conversion Triggers`  **(B)** and on New  **(C)**

- Select the triggering Salesforce object **(E)**
- Add a condition and fill in the value which should trigger the event. **(F)** Please note that you have to paste the API name of the field value. Exemple: You want to send an event to Google Ads when a lead is converted. Then you will have to select the API name of the Lead « Status » field
- Select what amount field should be sent as conversion value **(G)**
- Finally, select what Gclid field (unique advertising ID associated to a user) should be used. **(H)**
- You can select either `Heeet First Click Google Gclid` or `Heeet Last Click Google Gclid`.

Tip: if you want to use first click Gclid if last click Gclid is missing
or last click Gclid is first click Gclid is missing, ask a Salesforce
Admin to build a Formula Field in Salesforce (« GCLID ») taking
one or the other value.
